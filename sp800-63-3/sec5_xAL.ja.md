## 5. Determining Levels of Assurance

OMB M-04-04 requires agencies to select transaction or system authentication Level of Assurance (LOA) by conducting a risk assessment to determine the potential impact of an authentication error. In the context of M-04-04, LOA is defined as:

1. The degree of confidence in the vetting process used to establish the identity of the individual to whom the authenticator was issued, and
2. the degree of confidence that the individual who uses the credential is the individual to whom the credential was issued.

Per M-04-04, once an LOA is selected, the agency is required to follow the identity proofing, credentialing, and federation technical requirements specified by NIST at that level. For example, if the impact of an authentication error results in an application assessed at LOA 3, the agency must identity proof and provide authenticators that meet the requirements for LOA 3.

However, in today's digital services, combining proofing and authenticator requirements into a single bundle sometimes creates unintended consequences as well as putting unneccessary implementation burden upon the implementing entity. It is quite possible that an agency can deliver the most effective set of identity services by assessing the risk and impacts of failures for each individual component of digital authentication, not as a single, all encompassing LOA. An authentication error is not a singleton that drives all requirements. This guideline recommends that agencies meet M-04-04 requirements by separately evaluating the impact that could result from (1) a true authentication error (the wrong individual using someone else’s credential) and (2) an identity proofing error. From the perspective of an identity proofing failure, there are two dimensions of potential risk:

*  The impact of providing a service to the wrong person (e.g. an attacker successfully proofs as someone else)
*  The impact of excessive identity proofing (i.e. collecting more information about a person than is required to successfully provide the digital service.)

As such, agencies should assess the risk of authentication and proofing errors separately to determine the appropriate technical solutions that should be applied to their system. 

### 5.1. Categories of Assurance Levels

To determine the process and system requirements that reduce the risk of an authentication or identity proofing failure, this guideline introduces distinct categories of assurance which drive the technical solutions an agency may implement. They are:

* Identity Assurance Level (IAL) - the robustness of the identity proofing process to confidently determine the identity of an individual  
* Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) - the robustness of the authentication process itself, and the binding between an authenticator and the identifier of a specific individual.
* Federation Assurance Level (FAL) - the robustness of the assertion protocol utilized by the federation to communicate authentication and attribute information (if applicable) to a relying party. FAL is optional as not all digital systems will leverage federated identity architectures.

A summary of each of the identity, authenticator, and federation assurance levels is provided below.


| Identity Assurance Level |
|:----------------------:|
| **IAL1** - At this level, attributes provided in conjunction with the authentication process, if any, are self-asserted.|
| **IAL2** - IAL 2 introduces the need for either remote or in-person identity proofing. IAL 2 requires identifying attributes to have been verified in person or remotely using, at a minimum, the procedures given in [SP 800-63A](sp800-63a.html).|
| **IAL3** - At IAL 3, in-person identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified by an authorized representative of the CSP through examination of physical documentation as described in [SP 800-63A](sp800-63a.html).|

|Authenticator Assurance Level|
|:----------------------:|
|**AAL1** - AAL 1 provides some assurance that the claimant controls the authenticator registered to a subscriber. AAL 1 uses single-factor authentication using a wide range of available authentication technologies. Successful authentication requires that the claimant prove through a secure authentication protocol that he or she possesses and controls the authenticator.|
| **AAL2** – AAL 2 provides high confidence that the claimant controls the authenticator registered to a subscriber. Two different authentication factors are required. Approved cryptographic techniques are required at AAL 2 and above.|
|**AAL3** – AAL 3 provides very high confidence that the claimant controls the authenticator registered to a subscriber. Authentication at AAL 3 is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. AAL 3 is similar to AAL 2 except that a "hard" cryptographic authenticator that also provides impersonation resistance is required.|

|Federation Assurance Level|
|:----------------------:|
|**FAL1** - FAL 1 allows for the subscriber to retrieve and present a bearer assertion directly to the relying party (RP) in the front channel. The assertion must be signed with using approved cryptography.|
|**FAL2** - FAL 2 requires the subscriber to retrieve an assertion artifact to present to the RP, which the RP then presents to the CSP to fetch the bearer assertion in the back channel. The assertion must be signed using approved cryptography. Alternatively, if the assertion is presented in the front channel, the assertion is required to be encrypted such that the RP is the only party that can decrypt it.|
|**FAL3** - FAL 3 builds on FAL 2 and adds the requirement that the assertion be encrypted using approved cryptography such that the RP is the only party that can decrypt it.|
|**FAL4** - FAL 4 requires the subscriber to present proof of possession of a cryptographic key referenced in the assertion in addition to the assertion artifact itself. The assertion must be signed using approved cryptography and encrypted to the RP using approved cryptography.|

When described generically or bundled, this guideline will refer to the combination of IAL, AAL, and FAL as **_xAL_**.

A risk assessment to determine each xAL is recommended. [Section 5.3.](#CYOA) provides details on how agencies may going about making xAL selections. 


### 5.2. Mapping xAL to M-04-04 Levels of Assurance 

This guideline introduces a model where individual xALs can be selected without parity to each other in order to protect a digital service, as opposed to applying a single LOA where all xALs are equal. While options exist to select varying xALs for a system in many instances the same level will be chosen for all xALs. This provides an opportunity to directly map to the LOAs specified in M-04-04. [Table 5-1](#63sec5-Table1) shows strict adherence to M-04-04 by mapping the corresponding Identity, Authenticator, and Federation Assurance Levels to LOA.

<div class="text-center" markdown="1">

**Table 5-1. Mapping xAL to Legacy M-04-04 Requirements**

| M-04-04 Level of Assurance (LOA) | Identity Assurance Level (IAL)| Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) | Federation Assurance Level (FAL)
|:------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
| 2 | 2 | 2 | 2
| 3 | 2 | 2 | 2
| 4 | 3 | 3 | 4

>	Note: LOA2 is now equivalent to LOA3. Higher AALs than specified can always be used.
>

The ability to combine varying xALs offer significant flexibility to agencies, but not all combinations are possible due to the nature of the data collected from an individual and the authenticators to protect that data. [Table 5-2](#63sec5-Table2) details valid combinations of IAL and AAL to ensure personal information remains protected by multi-factor authentication.

<a name="63sec5-Table2"></a>

<div class="text-center" markdown="1">

**Table 5-2. Acceptable combinations of IAL and AAL**

</div>


| | IAL 1 | IAL 2 | IAL 3 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **AAL 1** | Allowed | **NO** | **NO** |
| **AAL 2** | Allowed | Allowed | See Note |
| **AAL 3** | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed |

> Note: Per Executive Order 13681 [[EO 13681]](#EO13681), the release of personal information requires protection with multifactor authentication. Therefore, it should not be possible to use an authenticator at a lower assurance level then the IAL. However, depending on the use case, specifically that the transaction that the user authenticates to does not release or manage any personal information, it could be possible for these combinations to exist, though unlikely and not recommended.

 
### 5.3. <a name="CYOA"></a>Selecting the Appropriate xAL

Agency mission and risk tolerance should drive the most advantageous selection of xALs to minimize risk. This could include the selection of an IAL that is lower than the selected AAL. For example, an agency may establish a "health tracker" application. In line with the terms of [Executive Order 13681](#EO13681) requiring "...that all agencies making personal data accessible to citizens through digital applications require the use of multiple factors of authentication...", the agency is required to implement multi-factor authentication at AAL 2 or 3. The EO also requires agencies employ "...an effective identity proofing process, as appropriate." when personal information is released. This does not mean that proofing at IAL 2 or 3 (to match the required AAL) is required for all scenarios when personal information is made available. In the above example, there may be no need for the agency system to know the true identity of the user. Therefore, an effective proofing process would be to not proof at all. In the past, an LOA3 assessment would equate to identity proofing the user at IAL2. This is no longer necessary and the agency is encouraged to not perform any identity proofing and allow the user of the health tracker system to be pseudonymous at IAL1.

Separating IAL and AAL also works for traditional M-04-04 LOA use cases, such as HSPD-12 requirements for federal employees to obtain a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) smart card. The requirement for PIV is that agencies meet LOA4; therefore, an authenticator at AAL3 **and** identity proofing at IAL 3 sufficiently meets the LOA4 requirements.

> Note: An agency can accept a higher assurance level than those required in the table above. For example, in a federated transaction, an agency can accept an IAL3 identity if their application is assessed at IAL2. The same holds true for authenticators; stronger authenticators can be used at RP's that have lower authenticator requirements. However, RPs will have to ensure that this only occurs in federated scenarios with appropriate privacy protections by the CSP such that only the requested attributes are provided to the RP and that excessive personal information does not leak from the authenticator or the assertion. See [privacy requirements](./sp800-63c.html#sec9) in SP 800-63C for more details.

<!---->

> Note: Since agencies are encouraged to consider each distinct element of assurance, the notion of the 'low watermark' to determine LOA no longer applies. An IAL1/AAL2 application should not be considered any less secure or privacy enhancing than an IAL2/AAL2 application. The only difference between these applications is the amount of proofing required, which may not impact the security and privacy of each application. That said, if an agency incorrectly determines the xAL, security and privacy could very well be impacted.

#### 5.3.1. Business Process vs. Online Transaction

An online transaction may not equate to a complete business process that requires offline processing, or online processing in a completely segmented system. In selecting the appropriate assurance levels, the agency should assess the risk associated with the online transactions they are offering via the digital service, not the entire business process associated with the provided benefit or service. For example, in an online survey, sensitive personally identifiable information may be collected, but it is never made available online to the person after the information is submitted. In this instance, it is important for the information to be carefully protected in backend systems, but there is no reason to identity proof or even authenticate the user providing the information. The online transaction is solely a submission of the data only. The entire business process may require a significant amount of data validation, without ever needing to know if the correct person submitted the correct information regarding their family. In this scenario, there is no need for any xAL.

Another example where the assessed risk could differ if the agency evaluated the entire business process rather than the online transaction requirements, is a digital service that accepts resumes in order to apply for open job postings. In this use case, the digital service allows any individual to submit a resume on behalf of anyone else, and in subsequent visits to the site, access the resume for various purposes. Since the resume information is provided in later sessions, and is considered personal information, the agency must select an AAL that requires MFA. In this case, the requirements of [[EO 13681]](#eo13681) apply, driving the AAL to be at least level 2. However, the identity proofing requirements remain unclear. The entire business process of examining a resume and ultimately interviewing a person requires a significant amount of identity proofing. The agency needs a high level of confidence that the job applicant/interviewee is in fact the subject of the resume submitted online if a decision to hire is made. Yet this level of proofing is not required to actually submit the resume online. Identity proofing is not required to complete the digital transaction successfully. The resume could be submitted by the applicant, but may also be submitted by a surrogate. Identity proofing the submitter would create more risk than required in the online system as excess personal information would be collected, such as from the surrogate, when no such information is needed. Therefore, the most appropriate IAL selection would be 1. There is no need to identity proof the user to successfully complete the online transaction, nor is there any potential negative impact as a result of offering the online transaction if a proofing failure occurred. Yet, there would be significant impact if the entire business process failed to correctly identity proof the person - a job may be offered to a fraudulent applicant - but that risk should not be applied holistically to the online system via a higher IAL.

> In this use case, it is assumed the system allows surrogates. If the use case is that the only person that can submit is the actual subject of the resume, then identity proofing requirements for the online transaction would be significantly different.

The AAL decision tree in [Figure 5-1](#63Sec5-Figure1) offers agencies a possible path to determine the most appropriate authentication requirements for their digital service offering. This analysis is not intended to substitute M-04-04 risk assessments or any other risk management process in use by the agency. Nor is it expected to cover all the identity service needs of each agencies unique mission. Descriptions follow for specific steps that fall outside the risk management process documented in M-04-04.

The AAL selection does not mean the digital service provider will need to issue authenticators themselves. More information of whether the agency can federate or not is provided in [Section 5.4](#toFedorNotToFed).

That said, personal information release at all AALs should be considered when performing the risk assessment. An important point at this step is that the collection of personal information, if made available online, does not need to be validated or verified to require an AAL of 2 or higher. Release of even self-asserted personal information requires account protection via MFA. Even though self-asserted information can be falsified, most users will provide accurate information to benefit from the digital service. As such, self-asserted data must be protected appropriately.</td>

In addition, proofing, when not required, or collecting more information than needed, is a risk in and of itself. Hence, obtaining verified attribute information when not needed is also considered an identity proofing failure. This step should identify if the agency answered Step 1 and 2 incorrectly, realizing they actually don't need personal information to deliver the service.

_Coming Soon_

### <a name="toFedorNotToFed"></a> 5.4. Federation Considerations

The technical guidelines detailed in NIST SP 800-63-3 and its companion volumes are agnostic to the authentication and identity proofing architecture an agency selects. However, there are scenarios an agency may encounter which make identity federation potentially more attractive than establishing identity services local to the agency or individual applications. The following list details the scenarios where an agency may consider federation as a viable option. This list does not factor in any economic benefits or weaknesses of federation vs. localized identity architectures.

**Federate Authenticators:**

*  Potential users already have an authenticator at or above required AAL  
*  Multiple credential form factors are required to cover all possible user communities
*  Agency does not have infrastructure to support authentication management (e.g., account recovery, authenticator issuance, help desk)

**Federate Attributes:**  

* Pseudonymity is important to stakeholders accessing the service
* Access to the service only requires a partial attribute list  
* Access to the service only requires at least one attribute claim
* Agency is not the authoritative source or issuing source for required attributes  
* Attributes are only required temporarily during use (such as to make an access decision), such that agency does not need to locally persist the data
