## 5. <a name="AAL_SEC5"></a>Authenticator and Verifier Requirements

This section provides the detailed requirements specific for each of the authenticator types. With the exception of reauthentication requirements specified in [Section 4](#AAL_SEC4), the technical requirements for each of the authenticator types is the same regardless of the AAL at which it is used.

### 5.1. Requirements by Authenticator Type

#### 5.1.1. Memorized Secrets

<div class="text-left" markdown="1">
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="sp800-63b/media/Memorized-secret.png" alt="authenticator" style="width: 100px;height: 100px"/></td>
    <td>A Memorized Secret authenticator (commonly referred to as a <i>password</i> or <i>PIN</i> if it is numeric) is a secret value that is intended to be chosen and memorizable by the user. Memorized secrets need to be of sufficient complexity and secrecy that it would be impractical for an attacker to guess or otherwise discover the correct secret value.</td> 
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>



##### 5.1.1.1. Memorized Secret Authenticators

Memorized secrets SHALL be at least 8 characters in length if chosen by the subscriber; memorized secrets chosen randomly by the CSP or verifier SHALL be at least 6 characters in length and MAY be entirely numeric.  Since the CSP or verifier may disallow some choices of memorized secrets  based on their appearance on a blacklist of compromised values, the subscriber SHALL choose a different memorized secret if a choice is rejected. No other complexity requirements for memorized secrets SHOULD be imposed; a rationale for this is presented in [Appendix A](#appA).

##### 5.1.1.2. Memorized Secret Verifiers

Verifiers SHALL require subscriber-chosen memorized secrets to be at least 8 characters in length. Verifiers SHOULD permit user-chosen memorized secrets to be at least 64 characters in length. All printing ASCII [[RFC 20]](#RFC20) characters as well as the space character SHOULD be acceptable in memorized secrets; Unicode [[ISO/ISC 10646:2014]](#ISOIEC10646) characters SHOULD be accepted as well. Verifiers MAY remove multiple consecutive space characters, or all space characters, prior to verification provided that the result is at least 8 characters in length. Truncation of the secret SHALL NOT be performed. For purposes of the above length requirements, each Unicode code point SHALL be counted as a single character.

If Unicode characters are accepted in memorized secrets, the verifier SHOULD apply the Normalization Process for Stabilized Strings defined in Section 12.1 of Unicode Standard Annex 15 [[UAX 15]](#UAX15) using either the NFKC or NFKD normalization. Subscribers choosing memorized secrets containing Unicode characters SHOULD be advised that some characters may be represented differently by some endpoints, which can affect their ability to authenticate successfully. This process is applied prior to hashing of the byte string representing the memorized secret.

Memorized secrets that are randomly chosen by the CSP (e.g., at enrollment) or by the verifier (e.g., when a user requests a new PIN) SHALL be at least 6 characters in length and SHALL be generated using an approved random bit generator.

Memorized secret verifiers SHALL NOT permit the subscriber to store a "hint" that is accessible to an unauthenticated claimant. Verifiers also SHALL NOT prompt subscribers to use specific types of information (e.g., "What was the name of your first pet?") when choosing memorized secrets.

When processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list of known commonly-used, expected, and/or compromised values. For example, the list MAY include (but is not limited to):

* Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses
* Dictionary words
* Context specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and derivates thereof

If the chosen secret is found in the list, the subscriber SHALL be advised that they need to select a different secret because their previous choice was commonly used, and be required to choose a different value.

Verifiers SHALL implement a throttling mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication attempts an attacker can make on the subscriber’s account as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle).

Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (mixtures of different character types, for example) on memorized secrets. Verifiers SHOULD NOT require memorized secrets to be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically) unless there is evidence of compromise of the authenticator or a subscriber requests a change.

In order to assist the claimant in entering a memorized secret successfully, the verifier SHOULD offer an option to display the secret (rather than a series of dots or asterisks, typically) as it is typed. The verifier SHALL hide the character after it is displayed for a time sufficient for the claimant to see the character. This allows the claimant to verify their entry if they are in a location where their screen is unlikely to be observed.

The verifier SHALL use approved encryption and SHALL utilize an authenticated protected channel when requesting memorized secrets in order to provide resistance to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Verifiers SHALL store memorized secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Secrets SHALL be hashed with a *salt* value using an approved hash function such as PBKDF2 as described in [[SP800-132]](#SP800-132). The salt value SHALL be a 32 bit (or longer) random value generated by an approved random bit generator and is stored along with the hash result. At least 10,000 iterations of the hash function SHOULD be performed. A keyed hash function (e.g., HMAC), with the key stored separately from the hashed authenticators (e.g., in a hardware security module) SHOULD be used to further resist dictionary attacks against the stored hashed authenticators.

#### 5.1.2. Look-up Secrets

<div class="text-left" markdown="1">
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="sp800-63b/media/Look-up-secrets.png" alt="authenticator" style="width: 100px;height: 100px"/></td>
    <td>A look-up secret authenticator is a physical or electronic record that stores a set of secrets shared between the claimant and the CSP. The claimant uses the authenticator to look up the appropriate secret(s) needed to respond to a prompt from the verifier. For example, a claimant may be asked by the verifier to provide a specific subset of the numeric or character strings printed on a card in table format.</td> 
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>

##### 5.1.2.1 Look-up Secret Authenticators
CSPs creating look-up secret authenticators SHALL use an approved random bit generator to generate the list of secrets, and SHALL deliver the authenticator securely to the subscriber. Look-up secrets SHALL have at least 64 bits of entropy, or SHALL have at least 20 bits of entropy if the number of failed authentication attempts is limited as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle).

If the authenticator uses look-up secrets sequentially from a list, the subscriber MAY dispose of used secrets, but only after a successful authentication.

##### 5.1.2.2. Look-up Secret Verifiers

Verifiers of look-up secrets SHALL prompt the claimant for the next secret from their authenticator or for a specific (i.e., numbered) secret. A given secret from an authenticator SHALL be used successfully only once; therefore, a given authenticator can only be used for a finite number of successful authentications. If the look-up secret is derived from a grid card, each cell of the grid SHALL be used only once.

Verifiers SHALL store look-up secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Secrets SHALL be hashed with a "salt" value using an approved hash function as described in [[SP 800-132]](#SP800-132). The "salt" value SHALL be a 128 bit (or longer) random value generated by an approved random bit generator that is stored along with the hash result. A keyed hash function (e.g., HMAC [[FIPS198-1]](#FIPS198-1)), with the key stored separately from the hashed authenticators (e.g., in a hardware security module) SHOULD be used to further resist dictionary attacks against the stored hashed authenticators.

Look-up secrets SHALL be generated using an approved random bit generator and SHALL have at least 20 bits of entropy. When look-up secrets have less than 64 bits of entropy, the verifier SHALL implement a throttling mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication attempts an attacker can make on the subscriber’s account as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle).

The verifier SHALL use approved encryption and SHALL utilize an authenticated protected channel when requesting look-up secrets in order to provide resistance to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

#### <a name="out-of-band"></a>5.1.3. Out-of-Band Devices

<div class="text-left" markdown="1">
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="sp800-63b/media/Out-of-band-OOB.png" alt="authenticator" style="width: 100px;height: 100px"/></td>
    <td>An out-of-band authenticator is a physical device that is uniquely addressable and can communicate securely with the verifier over a distinct communications channel, referred to as the secondary channel. The device is possessed and controlled by the claimant and supports private communication over this secondary channel that is separate from the primary channel for e-authentication. The out-of-band authenticator can operate in one of the following ways:<br><br>

- The claimant transfers a secret received by the out-of-band device via the secondary channel to the verifier using the primary channel. For example, the claimant may receive the secret on their mobile device and type it (typically a 6 digit code) into their authentication session.<br><br>

- The claimant transfers a secret received via the primary channel to the out-of-band device for transmission to the verifier via the secondary channel. For example, the claimant may view the secret on their authentication session and either type it into an app on their mobile device or use a technology such as a barcode or QR code to effect the transfer.<br><br>

- The claimant compares secrets received from the primary channel and the secondary channel and confirms the authentication via the secondary channel.<br><br>

The purpose of the secret is to securely bind the authentication operation on the primary and secondary channel. When the response is via the primary communication channel, the secret also establishes the claimant's control of the out-of-band device.</td> 
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>

##### 5.1.3.1. Out-of-Band Authenticators

The out-of-band authenticator SHALL establish a separate channel with the verifier in order to retrieve the out-of-band secret or authentication request. This channel is considered to be out-of-band with respect to the primary communication channel, even if it terminates on the same device, provided the device does not leak information from one to the other without the authorization of the claimant.

The out-of-band device SHALL be uniquely addressable and communication over the secondary channel SHALL be private. Some voice-over-IP telephone services can deliver text messages and voice calls without the need for possession of a physical device; these SHALL NOT be used for out-of-band authentication. Ability to receive email messages or other types of instant message does not generally prove the possession of a specific device, and therefore SHALL NOT be used as out-of-band authentication methods. Mechanisms such as smartphone applications that employ secure communications protocols and uniquely identify the out-of-band device SHOULD be used for out-of-band authentication.

The out-of-band authenticator SHALL uniquely authenticate itself in one of the following ways in communicating with the verifier:

- Establish an authenticated protected channel to the verifier using approved cryptography. The key used SHALL be stored in the most secure storage available on the device (e.g., keychain storage, trusted platform module, or trusted execution environment if available).

- Authenticate to a public mobile telephone network using a SIM card or equivalent that uniquely identifies the device. This method SHALL only be used if a secret is being sent from the verifier to the out-of-band device via the telephone network (SMS or voice).

If a secret is sent by the verifier to the out-of-band device, the device SHOULD NOT display the authentication secret on a device while it is locked by the owner (i.e., requires an entry of a PIN or passcode). However, authenticators MAY indicate the receipt of an authentication secret on a locked device.

If the out-of-band authenticator sends an approval message over the secondary communication channel (rather than by the claimant transferring a received secret to the primary communication channel), it SHALL do one of the following:

* The authenticator SHALL accept transfer of the secret from the primary channel which it SHALL send to the verifier over the secondary channel to associate the approval with the authentication transaction. The claimant MAY perform the transfer manually or use a technology such as a barcode or QR code to effect the transfer.

* The authenticator SHALL present a secret received via the secondary channel from the verifier and prompt the claimant to verify the consistency of that secret with the primary channel, prior to accepting a yes/no response from the claimant. It SHALL then send that response to the verifier.

##### 5.1.3.2. Out-of-Band Verifiers

Due to the risk that SMS messages or voice calls may be intercepted or redirected, implementers of new systems SHOULD carefully consider alternative authenticators. If the out-of-band verification is to be made using the public switched telephone network (PSTN), the verifier SHALL verify that the pre-registered telephone number being used is not associated with a VoIP (or other software-based) service. It then sends the SMS or voice message to the pre-registered telephone number. Changing the pre-registered telephone number SHALL NOT be possible without two-factor authentication at the time of the change.

> Note: Out-of-band authentication using the PSTN (SMS or voice) is deprecated, and is being considered for removal in future editions of this guideline.

If out-of-band verification is to be made using a secure application (e.g., on a smart phone), the verifier MAY send a push notification to that device. The verifier then waits for a establishment of an authenticated protected channel and verifies the authenticator's identifying key. The verifier SHALL NOT store the identifying key itself, but SHALL use a verification method such as hashing (using an approved hash function) or proof of possession of the identifying key to uniquely identify the authenticator. Once authenticated, the verifier transmits the authentication secret to the authenticator.

Depending on the type of out-of-band authenticator, one of the following SHALL take place:

* Transfer of secret to primary channel: The verifier MAY signal the device containing the subscriber's authenticator to indicate readiness to authenticate. It SHALL then transmit a random secret to the out-of-band authenticator. The verifier SHALL then wait for the secret to be returned on the primary communication channel.

* Transfer of secret to secondary channel: The verifier SHALL display a random authentication secret to the claimant via the primary channel. It SHALL then wait for the secret to be returned on the secondary channel from the claimant's out-of-band authenticator.

* Verification of secrets by claimant: The verifier SHALL display a random authentication secret to the claimant via the primary channel, and SHALL send the same secret to the out-of-band authenticator via the secondary channel for presentation to the claimant. It SHALL then wait for an approval (or disapproval) message via the secondary channel.

In all cases, the authentication SHALL be considered invalid if not completed within 5 minutes.

The verifier SHALL generate random authentication secrets with at least 20 bits of entropy using an approved random bit generator. If the authentication secret has less than 64 bits of entropy, the verifier SHALL implement a throttling mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication attempts an attacker can make on the subscriber’s account as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle).

#### 5.1.4. Single Factor OTP Device

<div class="text-left" markdown="1">
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="sp800-63b/media/Single-factor-otp-device.png" alt="authenticator" style="width: 100px;height: 100px"/></td>
    <td>A single factor OTP device supports the generation of one-time passwords. This includes hardware devices as well as software-based OTP generators installed on devices such as mobile phones. This device has an embedded secret that is used as the seed for generation of one-time passwords and does not require activation through a second factor. The one-time password is displayed on the device and manually input to the verifier, thereby proving possession and control of the device. A one-time password device may, for example, display 6 characters at a time. A single factor OTP device is <i>something you have</i>.<br><br>

Single factor OTP devices are similar to look-up secret authenticators with the exception that the secrets are cryptographically generated by the authenticator and verifier and compared by the verifier. The secret is computed based on a nonce that may be time-based or from a counter on the authenticator and verifier.</td> 
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>

##### <a name="sfotpa"></a>5.1.4.1. Single Factor OTP Authenticators

Single factor OTP authenticators contain two persistent values. The first is a symmetric key that persists for the lifetime of the device. The second is a nonce that is changed each time the authenticator is used or is based on a real-time clock.

The secret key and its algorithm SHALL provide at least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of [[SP 800-131A]](#SP800-131A) (currently 112 bits). The nonce SHALL be of sufficient length to ensure that it is unique for each operation of the device over its lifetime.

The authenticator output is obtained by using an approved block cipher or hash function to combine the key and nonce in a secure manner. The authenticator output MAY be truncated to as few as 6 decimal digits (approximately 20 bits of entropy).

If the nonce used to generate the authenticator output is based on a real-time clock, the nonce SHALL be changed at least once every 2 minutes. The OTP value associated with a given nonce SHALL be accepted only once.

##### 5.1.4.2. Single Factor OTP Verifiers

Single factor OTP verifiers effectively duplicate the process of generating the OTP used by the authenticator. As such, the symmetric keys used by authenticators are also present in the verifier, and SHALL be strongly protected against compromise.

When a multi-factor OTP authenticator is being associated with a subscriber account, the verifier (or associated CSP) SHALL obtain secrets required to duplicate the authenticator output from the authenticator source (typically its manufacturer) using approved cryptography.

The verifier SHALL use approved encryption and SHALL utilize an authenticated protected channel when collecting the OTP in order to provide resistance to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Time-based one-time passwords SHALL have a lifetime of less than 2 minutes.

If the authenticator output has less than 64 bits of entropy, the verifier SHALL implement a throttling mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication attempts an attacker can make on the subscriber’s account as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle).

#### 5.1.5. Multi-Factor OTP Devices

<div class="text-left" markdown="1">
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="sp800-63b/media/Multi-factor-otp-device.png" alt="authenticator" style="width: 100px;height: 100px"/></td>
    <td>A multi-factor (MF) OTP hardware device generates one-time passwords for use in authentication after activation through an additional authentication factor. The second factor of authentication may be achieved through some kind of integral entry pad, an integral biometric (e.g., fingerprint) reader or a direct computer interface (e.g., USB port). The one-time password is displayed on the device and manually input to the verifier. For example, a one-time password device may display 6 characters at a time, thereby proving possession and control of the device. The MF OTP device is <i>something you have</i>, and it SHALL be activated by either <i>something you know</i> or <i>something you are</i>.</td> 
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>


##### 5.1.5.1. Multi-Factor OTP Authenticators

Multi-factor OTP authenticators operate in a similar manner to single-factor OTP authenticators (see [Section 5.1.4.1](#sfotpa)), except that they require the entry of either a memorized secret or use of a biometric to obtain a password from the authenticator. Each use of the authenticator SHALL require the input of the additional factor.

The authenticator output SHALL have at least 6 decimal digits (approximately 20 bits) of entropy. The output SHALL be generated by using an approved block cipher or hash function to combine a symmetric key stored on a personal hardware device with a nonce to generate a one-time password. The nonce MAY be based on the date and time or on a counter generated on the device. 

Any memorized secret used by the authenticator for activation SHALL be at least 6 decimal digits (approximately 20 bits) in length or of equivalent complexity and SHALL be rate limited as specified in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle). A biometric activation factor SHALL meet the requirements of [Section 5.2.3](#biometric_use), including limits on number of successive authentication failures.

The unencrypted key and activation secret or biometric sample (and any biometric data derived from the biometric sample such as a probe produced through signal processing) SHALL be erased from memory immediately after a password has been generated.

##### 5.1.5.2. Multi-Factor OTP Verifiers

Multi-factor OTP verifiers effectively duplicate the process of generating the OTP used by the authenticator, but without the requirement that a second factor be provided. As such, the symmetric keys used by authenticators SHALL be strongly protected against compromise.

When a multi-factor OTP authenticator is being associated with a subscriber account, the verifier (or associated CSP) SHALL obtain secrets required to duplicate the authenticator output from the authenticator source (typically its manufacturer) using approved cryptography. The verifier or CSP SHALL also obtain an assertion from the authenticator source that the authenticator is a multi-factor device. In the absence of a trusted assertion that it is a multi-factor device, the verifier SHALL treat it the authenticator as single factor, in accordance with section 5.1.4.

The verifier SHALL use approved encryption and SHALL utilize an authenticated protected channel when collecting the OTP in order to provide resistance to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Time-based one-time passwords SHALL have a lifetime of less than 2 minutes.

If the authenticator output or activation secret has less than 64 bits of entropy, the verifier SHALL implement a throttling mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication attempts an attacker can make on the subscriber’s account as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle). A biometric activation factor SHALL meet the requirements of [Section 5.2.3](#biometric_use), including limits on number of successive authentication failures.

    <td>A single factor cryptographic device is a hardware device that performs cryptographic operations using protected cryptographic key(s) and provides the authenticator output via direct connection to the user endpoint. The device uses embedded symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic keys, and does not require activation through a second factor of authentication. Authentication is accomplished by proving possession of the device via the authentication protocol. The authenticator output is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic device and protocol, but it is typically some type of signed message. A single factor cryptographic device is <i>something you have</i>.</td> 
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>

##### 5.1.6.1. Single Factor Cryptographic Device Authenticators

Single-factor cryptographic device authenticators encapsulate a secret key that is unique to the device and SHALL NOT be exportable (removed from the device). They operate by signing a challenge nonce, usually presented through a direct computer interface such as a USB port.

The secret key and its algorithm SHALL provide at least the minimum security length specified in the latest revision of [[SP 800-131A]](#SP800-131A) (currently 112 bits). The challenge nonce SHALL be at least 64 bits in length. The authenticator output is normally provided via a computer interface (usually the same one from which the challenge value was received).

Single-factor cryptographic device authenticators SHOULD require a physical input such as the pressing of a button in order to operate. This provides defense against unintended operation of the device, which might occur if the device to which it is connected is compromised.

##### 5.1.6.2. Single Factor Cryptographic Device Verifiers

Single-factor cryptographic device verifiers generate a challenge nonce, send it to the corresponding authenticator, and use the authenticator output to verify possession of the device. The authenticator output is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic device and protocol, but it is generally some type of signed message.

The verifier has either symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic keys corresponding to each authenticator. While both types of keys SHALL be protected against modification, symmetric keys SHALL additionally be strongly protected against unauthorized disclosure.

The challenge nonce SHALL be at least 64 bits in length, and SHALL either be unique over the lifetime of the authenticator or statistically unique (generated using an approved random bit generator).
    
#### 5.1.7. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Software

The MF software cryptographic authenticator is <i>something you have</i>, and it SHALL be activated by either <i>something you know</i> or <i>something you are</i>.</td> 
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>



##### 5.1.7.1. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Software Authenticators

Multi-factor software cryptographic authenticators encapsulate a secret key that is unique to the authenticator and is accessible only through the input of an additional factor, either a memorized secret or a biometric. The key SHOULD be stored in the most secure storage available on the device (e.g., keychain storage, trusted platform module, or trusted execution environment if available).

Each authentication operation using the authenticator SHALL require the input of the additional factor.

Any memorized secret used by the authenticator for activation SHALL be at least 6 decimal digits (approximately 20 bits) in length or of equivalent complexity and SHALL be rate limited as specified in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle). A biometric activation factor SHALL meet the requirements of [Section 5.2.3](#biometric_use), and SHALL include limits on number of successive authentication failures.

The unencrypted key and activation secret or biometric sample (and any biometric data derived from the biometric sample such as a probe produced through signal processing) SHALL be erased from memory immediately after an authentication transaction has taken place.

##### 5.1.7.2. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Software Verifiers

The requirements for a multi-factor cryptographic software verifier are identical to those for a multi-factor cryptographic device verifier, described in [Section 5.1.8.2](#mfcdv).

#### 5.1.8. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Devices

##### 5.1.8.1. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Device Authenticators

Multi-factor cryptographic device authenticators use tamper-resistant hardware to encapsulate a secret key that is unique to the authenticator and is accessible only through the input of an additional factor, either a memorized secret or a biometric. The secret key and its algorithm SHALL provide at least the minimum security length specified in the latest revision of [[SP 800-131A]](#SP800-131A) (currently 112 bits). Approved cryptography SHALL be used.

The authenticator output is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic device and protocol, but it is generally some type of signed message.

Each authentication operation using the authenticator SHOULD require the input of the additional factor. Input of the additional factor MAY be accomplished via either direct input on the device or via a hardware connection (e.g., USB or smartcard).

Any memorized secret used by the authenticator for activation SHALL be at least 6 decimal digits (approximately 20 bits) in length or of equivalent complexity and SHALL be rate limited as specified in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle). A biometric activation factor SHALL meet the requirements of [Section 5.2.3](#biometric_use), and SHALL include limits on number of successive authentication failures.

The unencrypted key and activation secret or biometric sample (and any biometric data derived from the biometric sample such as a probe produced through signal processing) SHALL be erased from memory immediately after an authentication transaction has taken place.

##### <a name="mfcdv"></a>5.1.8.2 Multi-Factor Cryptographic Device Verifiers

Multi-factor cryptographic device verifiers generate a challenge nonce, send it to the corresponding authenticator, and use the authenticator output to verify possession of the device and activation factor.

The verifier has either symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic keys corresponding to each authenticator. While both types of keys SHALL be protected against modification, symmetric keys SHALL additionally be strongly protected against unauthorized disclosure.

The challenge nonce SHALL be at least 64 bits in length, and SHALL either be unique over the lifetime of the authenticator or statistically unique (generated using an approved random bit generator). The verification operation SHALL use approved cryptography.

#### 5.2. General Authenticator Requirements

#### 5.2.1. Physical Authenticators

CSPs SHALL provide subscriber instructions on how to appropriately  protect the authenticator against theft or loss. The CSP SHALL provide a mechanism to revoke or suspend the authenticator immediately upon notification from subscriber that loss or theft of the authenticator is suspected.

#### <a name="throttle"></a>5.2.2. Rate Limiting (Throttling)

*cf. 800-63-2 sec 8.2.3, p.75*

When the authenticator output or activation secret does not have sufficient entropy, the verifier SHALL implement controls to protect against online guessing attacks. Unless otherwise specified in the description of a given authenticator, the verifier SHALL effectively limit online attackers to 100 consecutive failed attempts on a single account in any 30 day period.

Additional techniques MAY be used to prioritize authentication attempts that are likely to come from the subscriber over those that are more likely to come from an attacker:

- Requiring the claimant to complete a Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) before attempting authentication

- Requiring the claimant to wait for a short period of time (anything from 30 seconds to an hour, depending on how close the system is to its maximum allowance for failed attempts) before attempting Authentication following a failed attempt

- Only accepting authentication requests from a white list of IP addresses at which the subscriber has been successfully authenticated before

- Leveraging other risk-based or adaptive authentication techniques to identify user behavior that falls within, or out of, typical norms.

Since these measures often create user inconvenience, the verifier SHOULD allow a certain number of failed authentication attempts before employing the above techniques. 

When the subscriber successfully authenticates, the verifier SHOULD disregard any previous failed attempts from the same IP address.

#### <a name="biometric_use"></a>5.2.3. Use of Biometrics

For a variety of reasons, this document supports only limited use of biometrics for authentication. These include:

- Biometric False Match Rates (FMR) and False Non-Match Rates (FNMR) do not provide confidence in the authentication of the subscriber by themselves. In addition, FMR and FNMR do not account for spoofing attacks.
- Biometric matching is probabilistic, whereas the other authentication factors are deterministic.
- Biometric template protection schemes provide a method for revoking biometric credentials that are comparable to other authentication factors (e.g., PKI certificates and passwords). However, the availability of such solutions is limited, and standards for testing these methods are under development.
- Biometric characteristics do not constitute secrets.  They can be obtained online or by taking a picture of someone with a camera phone (e.g. facial images) with or without their knowledge, lifted from through objects someone touches (e.g., latent fingerprints), or captured  with high resolution images (e.g., iris patterns for blue eyes). While presentation attack detection (PAD) technologies such as liveness detection can mitigate the risk of these types of attacks, additional trust in the sensor is required to ensure that PAD is operating properly in accordance with the needs of the CSP and the subscriber.

Therefore, the use of biometrics for authentication is supported, with the following requirements and guidelines:

Biometrics SHALL be used with another authentication factor (something you know or something you have).

Empirical testing of the biometric system to be deployed SHALL demonstrate an equal error rate of **1 in 1000** or better with respect to matching performance. The biometric system SHALL operate with a false match rate of **1 in 1000** or better.

When the biometric sensor and subsequent processing are not part of an integral unit that resists replacement of the sensor, the sensor (or endpoint with which it is an integral unit that resists sensor replacement) SHALL demonstrate that it is a certified or qualified sensor meeting these requirements by authenticating itself to the processing element.

The biometric system SHOULD implement presentation attack protection (PAD). Testing of the biometric system to be deployed SHOULD demonstrate at least 90% resistance to presentation attacks for each relevant attack type (aka species), where resistance is defined as the number of thwarted presentation attacks divided by the number of trial presentation attacks.

>Note: Presentation attack detection is being considered as a mandatory requirement in future editions of this guideline.

The biometric system SHALL allow no more than 3 consecutive failed authentication attempts, or 10 consecutive failed attempts if presentation attack detection meeting the above requirements is implemented. Once that limit has been reached, the claimant SHALL be required to use a different authenticator or to activate their authenticator with a different factor such as a memorized secret.

Biometric matching SHOULD be performed locally on claimant's device or MAY be performed at a central verifier. 

If matching is performed centrally:

* Use of the biometric SHALL be bound tightly to a single, specific device that is identified using approved cryptography.
* Biometric revocation SHOULD be implemented.
* An authenticated protected channel between sensor (or integral unit containing endpoint and sensor that resists sensor replacement) and central verifier SHALL be established, and the sensor authenticated, **prior** to capturing the biometric sample from the claimant.
* All transmission of biometrics shall be over the authenticated protected channel.

Biometric samples collected in the authentication process MAY be used to train matching algorithms or, with user consent, for other research purposes. Biometric samples (and any biometric data derived from the biometric sample such as a probe produced through signal processing) SHALL be erased from memory immediately after a password has been generated.

Biometrics are also used in some cases to prevent repudiation of registration and to verify that the same individual participates in all phases of the registration process as described in SP 800-63A.

#### <a name="attestation"></a>5.2.4 Attestation

Authenticators that are directly connected to or embedded in endpoints MAY convey attestation information such as the provenance or health and integrity of the authenticator (and possibly the endpoint as well) to the verifier as part of the authentication protocol. If this attestation is signed, it SHALL be signed using a difital signature that provides at least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of [[SP 800-131A]](#SP800-131A) (currently 112 bits). Attestation information MAY be used as part of a risk-based authentication decision.

When federated authentication is being performed as described in [SP 800-63C](sp800-63c.html), the verifier SHOULD include any such attestation information in the assertion it provides to the relying party.

#### <a name="verifimpers"></a>5.2.5 Verifier impersonation resistance

Verifier impersonation attacks, sometimes referred to as "phishing attacks", refer to attempts by fraudulent verifiers and relying parties to fool an unwary claimant into authenticating to an impostor website. In previous editions of SP 800-63, protocols that are resistant to verifier impersonation attacks were also referred to as "strongly man-in-the-middle resistant".

Authentication protocols that are verifier impersonation resistant SHALL authenticate the verifier and either:

1. Strongly and irreversibly bind the authenticator output to the public key of the certificate presented by the verifier to which it is sent, or to that verifier's authenticated hostname or domain name; or

2. Determine whether the verifier's authenticated hostname or domain name is on a list of trusted verifiers, and release the authenticator output only to a verifier on that list.

One example of the former class of verifier impersonation resistant authentication protocols is client-authenticated TLS, because the client signs the authenticator output along with earlier messages from the protocol that are unique to the particular TLS connection being negotiated. Other protocols that MAY be used are techniques that irreversibly include the verifier's hostname or domain in the generation of the authenticator output, making that authenticator output unusable by a fraudulent verifier (the attacker) if proxied to the intended verifier.

The latter class of verifier impersonation resistant protocols relies on access control to release the authenticator output only to trusted verifiers.

In contrast, authenticators that involve the manual entry of an authenticator output, such as out of band and one-time password authenticators, SHALL NOT be considered verifier impersonation resistant because they assume the vigilance of the claimant to determine that they are communicating with the intended verifier.
